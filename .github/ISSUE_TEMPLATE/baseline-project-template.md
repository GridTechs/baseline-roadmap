about: Resource for creating a master epic for a new project in the baseline protocol
  community.
title: project-template
labels: Epic
assignees: ''

``` This template is for writing what we call the "master epic" for a project. In the Baseline Protocol community, it is a common practice to start with one Epic (an Issue in github that has been marked as "Epic" and included in our zenhub kanban board). We work together to build up a well-articulated plan in the description and in comments.  And then we break it up into smaller parts (smaller-epics, stories, tasks) to manage the actual work. In the end, a good project will have a master epic that everyone can find on the Baseline roadmap that contains all the smaller Issues, so we can find all the work in one place and know from the project description what the point of the work is.```

## Project Description
Use this section to describe the purpose of the project. Try to give it a great name people will remember. 

## Impact on the Baseline Community
Tell us how you see this project fitting into the overall Baseline Protocol. Will it provide a new component? An improvement to some existing component like messaging? A demo showing a new way to use the baseline approach? What should other projects be aware of to make sure they can make use of the work in this project? If you know specific people who should be kept in the loop or involved in this project, list them here, ideally using their github ID references.

## Acceptance criteria and must have scope
Define what is a must-have for launch and in-scope. Keep this section fluid and dynamic until you lock-in priority during planning.

## Timeline
What's the timeline for this Epic, what resources are needed, and what might potentially block this work.
Don't worry! This is not a commitment for a deadline. The timeframe can always change. Be bold and brave...make a guess. It helps focus volunteers and increases the chances of success, even if you wind up expanding the timeframe several times before completion.

[Background](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000010341) on Epics, Issues, Checkboxes (aka, Epics, Stories, Tasks)

After you start breaking this master epic up into a set of Issues (sub-epics, stories, tasks, etc), you might consider creating a Project in Github to make it easy for your group to have a single Kanban board for just this work. The Github projects tab in any given repo will allow only Issues from that repo, but if you create one [here](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum-oasis/projects), you will be able to set up a project that can compose Issues from any of the baseline repos, including the core /baseline repo and the planning /baseline-roadmap repo.
